## Assignment Overview

What challenged you about this assignment?

Building the physical circuit is somewhat challenging
What did you learn during this assignment?
There's an internal AD converter inside the Arduino, which is convenient.
Were you unable to complete anything? Explain:

Is there anything we should know about your work on this assignment:



## Assignment Questions

In a few sentences, what does PWM do, on a physical level? Can the Arduino 
actually output a voltage that is not 0 or 5 Volts?
	PWM changes the portion of the time the signal spends "on" versus the time it spends "off".
To the human eyes, if the time "on" of the LED >> time "off", the LED appears brighter. This creates an illusion of an "analog" signal going into the LED.
In reality, the Arduino only outputs voltage of either 0 or 5 volts.
  

In a few sentences, how does your program convert the input from `analogRead` 
into a voltage? Could you generalize this into an equation to get a voltage
given an `analogRead`?
	analogRead gives out values from 0 to 1023. These are the voltage levels between 0 and 5 volts. The actual voltage can be computed by V = (5/1024)*val where val
is the output of analogRead

Why do you have to put resistors on the circuit?
	The LED itself has very low resistance. Without an external resistor to control the current flow, the LED might be destroyed because of too much current.
