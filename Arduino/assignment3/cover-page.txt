## Assignment Questions

Dolbear's Law is an equation that gives you a temperature from a number of
cricket chirps in one minute. What is the equation that provides the chirp 
period given a temperature in Celcius?

period = 60000/(7*Tc-30);  (milliseconds)


Using the datasheet for your temperature sensor, the equation you derived
from it, and you knowledge of the Arduino, what is the expected `analogRead()`
value for 25 Celcius? 15 Celcius? Include any assumptions, like 
`analogReference()`, and a little bit of your work (an equation is fine).

Since   temp = (1.1/1023)*val*100-50; for analogReference(INTERNAL)

Thus  for temp = 25, val = 697.5 which correspond to analogRead()=698 assuming analogRead() will round down.
      for temp = 15, val = 604.5 which correspond to analogRead()=604

What temperature range is the TMP36 specified for? How accurate is it in this
range? This can be answered looking solely at the overview and specifications
pages.

Between -40 Celsius and +125 Celsius. The accuracy is +/- 2 Celsius.
