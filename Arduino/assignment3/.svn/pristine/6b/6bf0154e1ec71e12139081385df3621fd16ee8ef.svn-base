## Assignment Questions

Dolbear's Law is an equation that gives you a temperature from a number of
cricket chirps in one minute. What is the equation that provides the chirp 
period given a temperature in Celcius?

Using the datasheet for your temperature sensor, the equation you derived
from it, and you knowledge of the Arduino, what is the expected `analogRead()`
value for 25 Celcius? 15 Celcius? Include any assumptions, like 
`analogReference()`, and a little bit of your work (an equation is fine).

What temperature range is the TMP36 specified for? How accurate is it in this
range? This can be answered looking solely at the overview and specifications
pages.
